# Gemgem

This is the sample application for [the Trailblazer book](https://leanpub.com/trailblazer).

The gemgem app is an Open Source repository. Nevertheless, I kindly ask you to buy my book even if you can learn everything you need from this repository.

Creating Trailblazer and working on all the involved gems over the past 10 years has consumed an incredible amount of my time. I loved and still love every minute of it but a way to support that is [purchasing a copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/trailblazer). As the book is still a work in progress, the latest setup and configuration guidelines are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/apotonick/gemgem-trbrb/wiki/Things-You-Should-Know).

Thanks so much!
